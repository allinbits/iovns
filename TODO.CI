1) CI should check that TX routes exposed and CLI tx commands for each module match the total number of messages for the module itself
2) CI should verify that request models of Rest and CLI for each module match the ones of the module itself until we can better abstract the query/txs to fit inside CLI and RestAPI

3) Abstract test cases better with GotErr, ExpectedError to make tests less verbose and also add helper functions to add state to avoid same operations repetition
